## Project Workflow

To understand Sailor Shift's influence and identify rising stars in Oceanus Folk, we followed a structured, multi-stage methodology:

### 1. Data Preparation

-   **Source**: MC1_graph.json (knowledge graph).
-   **Parsing**: Extracted and cleaned nodes and edges, resolving duplicates, missing values, and converting `release_date` to year format.
-   **Transformation**:
    -   Filtered for influence-related relationships (e.g., InspiredBy, InterpolatesFrom).
    -   Generated node features like centrality, genre, affiliation, and timestamps.

### 2. Graph Construction

-   Built a directed influence network with:
    -   Nodes: Artists, Songs, Albums, Labels.
    -   Edges: Relationships representing stylistic or collaborative influence.
-   Derived ego-networks for each artist and genre to explore local impact.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   **Temporal Trends**:\
    Analyzed number of influence edges per year, highlighting peak years and cyclical trends.

-   **Network Structure**:

    -   Identified high-degree nodes and subgraphs using centrality measures.
    -   Mapped artist influence paths and collaboration clusters.

-   **Genre Focus**:

    -   Filtered and visualized Oceanus Folk songs and relationships.
    -   Assessed frequency and strength of influence within and across genres.

EDA helped identify Sailor Shift's peak influence years and the structure of her immediate artistic neighborhood, guiding feature design for prediction modeling.

### 4. Feature Engineering

-   Created six predictive features for rising star analysis:
    1.  `score_performer`: â‰¥3 notable songs in 2030â€“2035.
    2.  `score_cluster`: â‰¥2 notable songs released within a 2â€“3 year period.
    3.  `score_multirole`: Artist played multiple creative roles.
    4.  `score_crossover`: Connections to other genres.
    5.  `score_label`: Signed or distributed by a label.
    6.  `score_sampled`: Songs sampled, covered, or referenced by others.

### 5. Scoring Logic

Each artist was scored based on presence of the six traits. The final `total_score` is computed as the sum of all active traits.

``` r
total_score = score_performer + score_cluster + score_multirole + 
              score_crossover + score_label + score_sampled
```

### 6. LASSO Regression

-   Applied LASSO to shrink non-contributory traits and identify those with highest predictive power.
-   Refitted a linear model with only selected features for simplicity and interpretability.
