Bertin‐Mahieux et al. (2011) built a large‐scale collaboration network in their study from Million Song Dataset metadata, showing that centrality measures correlate with streaming popularity. Similarly, Cronin et al. (2019) used bipartite artist‐song networks to detect emergent genre clusters"

DBpedia’s music ontology and MusicBrainz’s relational schema are widely used to power recommendation systems and semantic queries. Elasticsearch‐backed knowledge graphs (e.g., Pichl et al., 2017) combine text attributes (lyrics, reviews) with structural relations to improve music recommendation."

These embedding methods can capture structural equivalences—e.g., two indie‐folk artists who both consistently work on “collaborative splits.”"
