## Exploratory Data Analysis

### ðŸŽ¯ Influence Trend

-   Peak influence year: **2028**, with **9** connections.
-   Other spikes observed in **2031**, **2034**, **2036**, and **2038**.
-   Suggests cycles of renewed cultural relevance or stylistic resurgence.

### ðŸŽ¯ Statistical Regression

-   Fitted trendline: **+0.55 songs/year**.
-   However, regression not statistically significant (p = 0.329).
-   RÂ² value (\~7.9%) indicates only a small share of variance is explained by time alone.

## Network Analysis

-   **Network Centrality**:\
    Sailor Shift is a high-degree central node, both influencing and being influenced.
-   **Subgraph Neighbors**:\
    Key collaborators include:
    -   **Beatrice Albright**
    -   **Rainfall Fiction**
    -   **The Saltwater Weavers**

These connections reinforce Sailor Shift's role as a stylistic bridge within the genre.

## Predictive Modeling: Rising Stars

-   **Step 1: Feature Design**\
    Defined 6 forward-looking traits (e.g. performer role with recent notable songs, tightly clustered notable releases, multirole, artistâ€™s recent songs haveÂ influence edges to other genres, having a label, recently sampled or referenced by others).

-   **Step 2: Scoring Artists**\
    Applied scoring logic to assign score values per artist.

-   **Step 3: Total Score Creation**\
    Summed the 6 features to create a total_score as the target outcome.

-   **Step 4: LASSO Modeling**\
    Used LASSO regression to select the most predictive features.

-   **Step 5: Refit Final Model**\
    Trained a simple linear model using only the selected features.

-   **Step 6: Predict & Rank**\
    Generated predictions and identified top potential rising stars.

### ðŸ§  Feature Impact (Post-LASSO)

Top predictive traits: - `score_performer` - `score_sampled` - `score_multirole`

### ðŸ”¢ Top Predicted Rising Stars

| Artist               | Total Score | Key Traits                    |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Beatrice Albright    | 4           | Performer, Cluster, Multirole |
| Daniel O'Connell     | 3           | Performer, Cluster, Multirole |
| Copper Canyon Ghosts | 3           | Performer, Cluster            |

Traits like versatility and being sampled by others stand out as signals of rising potential.
