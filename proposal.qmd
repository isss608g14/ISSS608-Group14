## Data preparation and wrangling

## Shiny Application Modules

| **Library** | **Primary Functions** | **Use in This Project** |
|----|----|----|
| `janitor` | Data cleaning utilities, especially for column names | Used `clean_names()` to standardize column names for easier downstream manipulation |
| `tidyverse` | Data wrangling (`dplyr`, `tidyr`), plotting (`ggplot2`), manipulation | Filtering artists, cleaning datasets, joining tables, plotting timelines and charts |
| `jsonlite` | Reading and parsing JSON files | Likely used to import the JSON-based knowledge graph dataset |
| `visNetwork` | Interactive graph/network visualizations | Used for building interactive knowledge graphs of artists and genres |
| `tidygraph` | Graph manipulation in tidy format | Constructing tidy node-edge relationship data for network analysis |
